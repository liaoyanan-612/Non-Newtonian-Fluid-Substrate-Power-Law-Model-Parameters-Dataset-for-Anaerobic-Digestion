# Non-Newtonian-Fluid-Substrate-Power-Law-Model-Parameters-Dataset-for-Anaerobic-Digestion
This database is designed to provide comprehensive rheological information for typical substrates used in anaerobic digestion. It focuses on the power-law model parameters (K and n values) of non-Newtonian fluid substrates, which are critical for understanding and optimizing the flow behavior during the anaerobic digestion process.

# Key Features of the Database: 
Broad Data Coverage: The database includes rheological data for various substrates commonly used in anaerobic digestion, such as organic waste, agricultural residues, and other typical feedstocks.
Power-Law Model Parameters: The database provides power-law model parameters (K and n values) for non-Newtonian fluids, essential for describing shear-thinning or shear-thickening behaviors of substrates.
Data-Driven Optimization: Using clustering and regression analysis, the database supports the understanding of rheological behavior across different substrates and aids in optimizing the anaerobic digestion process.

# Data Collaboration and Expansion:
We actively encourage researchers in the field to contribute to the expansion and enhancement of this database. The ongoing update of this resource will include additional substrate types and data under varying operational conditions, thereby offering a more comprehensive resource for future research. Collaborative expansion of this database will enhance the reliability and representativeness of rheological property predictions for different anaerobic digestion feedstocks.

# Collaboration Invitation:
We invite experts and researchers to participate in expanding the database. If you have relevant research data and are willing to share, please feel free to contact us.
